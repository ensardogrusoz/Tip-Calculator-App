## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

This is my first time using xcode and making any mobile app, coming into it I thought that it will be difficult to get used to and understand.
However, after messing around with it for a couple of hours I found iOS app development very interesting and easy using XCode.
Because of the amazing features in XCode, building an iOS app is a fun. 

I wanted the UI to look the same on every Iphone but I had trouble understanding how the constraints work, after watching some tutorials I understood it a little better
